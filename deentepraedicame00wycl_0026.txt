XXll INTRODUCTION.

the case of the XIII Quaestiones. The copyist, we are almost forced
to believe, did his very best towards rendering his writing as illegible
as possible. The editor, who has for the last eight years been occupied
with XVth Century MSS„ of which many were rather illegible, rnust
admit that he never met with so hard a palaeographic problem as
the present one. All through the work we continually meet with
sentences that must rather be guessed at than read: and I may add
with much satisfaction that my esteetned fellow—worker in Wyclif,
Mr. Dziewicki, fully endorses rny opinion as to the difficulty of deci-
phering the MS. The principal defect of the scribe is his excessive
thoughtlessness‚ which absolutely required the revision of a corrector:
but there are still many regrettable mistakes to be found in the work,
which in general can hardly be corrected by the guesses ofa modern
editor. We may give an extremely characteristic instance, showing
how much the MS. has suffered in its successive transcriptions. On
p. 261, we read: “Alia autem est forma extrinseca ..... et talis
dicitur esse forma exemplaris rei, que non est aliud quam exemplar
ad quod respicit opffex, ut ad eius similitudinem formet opus suum
sicut poliges kopyto¹ respicit sutor, ut secundum ipsam formam
soleam diciturforma solee.'’ The words, poliges Kopym, though quite
incomprehensible, are unmistakably distinct, and I could make nothing
of them until Ι remembered that the same idea was to be found in
De Ente Predicamentali‚ p. 148. Robert Grosseteste is the authority
cited in both passages (Ep. 1; see notes and index), and an inspection of
the original shows that poliges Kopy'lo is, a mistake, for “pes ligneus ad
quem''‚ &ol There is no need for comment on such corruption of
the text, that baffles every conjecture of criticisrn3 but two conclusions
may be drawn hence. First that the basis with which we have to deal is
very far from certain. Second, that the knowledge of the sources from
which Wyclif draws is indispensable for the reconstruction of the text.

With this second treatise‚ as with the first, the greatest trouble
has been taken to verify every reference. They have been collected
together in order to assist a comparative study of sources, and the
Greek texts have been given in the original, although Ι was of course

means in Bohemian the very sanie as pes ligneum a cobbler’s last.
