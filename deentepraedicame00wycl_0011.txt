INTRODUCTION. VII

tractatus primus de ente in communi; and on the same line: Incipit
tractatus secundus libri de ente primo in communi; and Shirley's
treatise follows (p. 2, NO 8, Book ΙΙ). Here too we find, on ff. 168
and 169 for instance the appropriate heading:

F. 168⁴ F. 169

ΛΑ

Shirley's statement as to pagination requires correction here,
Book 1, 1, 2, does not end at f. 167 (as stated p. 3, end). but goes on
to f. 177, where we read the closing words of tr. 2: “indirecte occasio
peccandi'’. We must also notice a regrettable omission in Shirley's
otherwise valuable catalogue. F. 177‘ begins with the words Consequens
est purgare: it is the treatise referred to p. 2, Νο 8, Book Ι, 3; but
Shirley does not mention this. The copyist, intending to remove all
doubts as to the connection of this treatise with the former ones, has
taken care to point it out as before, by a note at the top of the page;
and we find on ff.181¹‚ 182,

 

F. 181‘ F. 182

d'enteioffl Tctat939 lib’ p’m9 Cam3¹¹²

in the same hand as all along. This third treatise ends on f. 184 with
ihe words Talia signa oportet, as given by Shirley.

Leaving f. 184, we come, on f. 185, to the words: Obiciencium
contra dicta de universalibus, unfortunately without any heading; but
there is no doubt whatever that it is identical with Shirley’s treatise
