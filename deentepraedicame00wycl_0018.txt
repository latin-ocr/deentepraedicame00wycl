XIV INTRODUCTION.

There is however a seemingly very weighty objection against
this date. We read at the very beginning of the treatise the following
words: “Et ex isto patet quod omnes pretericiones et futuricioneS,
cum sint eterne, independentes ab existencia substancie‚ non possunt
diei accidencia substancie create, et in multo magis negaciones, ut
patet tractata de Veritate capitulo 4⁰⁷⁹. It at first seemed probable
to me that Wyclif was referring to his own treatise De Verz'tate
Sacrae Scripturae; and Ι took that for granted, not having the treatise
at hand at the time (it belongs to the series of yet unpublished
works), and not being able to identify Anselrn's book De Veritate,
in a quotation of so vague a description. When Wyclif quotes the
great Saint of Canterbury‚ he usually employs more determinate
expressions, such as (p. 84, 16): Unde . .. docet Anselmus in libello
suo de Veritate; or (p. 102, 13). Et confirmacio istius est Anselmus
in De Veritate‚ capitulo 80; or again (p. 172, 21): Anselmus in De
Veritate. Now, if this quotation really belonged to Wyclif’s treatise
De Veritate Sacrae Scripturae‚ we should be obliged to ascribe a much
later date to the whole of De Ente, which would then have been
written towards the close of the seventh decade of the fourteenth
century.

But such is not the case. lhave since had the opportunity of seeing
the Vienna MS. Dc Veritaze Sacrae Scripturae. A close perusal of the
whole of the fourth chapter convinced me that it contained nothing
concerning the accidents of the substancia creata, or the negacz‘ones.
On the other hand it seems quite possible that Wyclif alludes not to
Ch. 4 but Ch. 2 of Anselm’s De Veritate. In this place (Migne, Ser.
lat. Vol. CLVIII, col. 471) the writer expounds the essence of the
Affirmation and the Negation in regard to proposition. We may
therefore completely and decidedly set aside the idea of a quotation
from Wyclif‘s treatise‚ and this objection against the date assigned
by us falls to the ground.

4. Critieal examination of the text in its present state.

A fact that seldorn occurs in the series of Wyclif's writings, is
noticeable: the written basis of the edited text consists of only one
MS.‚ the Cod. 4307, already described by us in the Introduction to
