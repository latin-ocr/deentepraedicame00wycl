1. Contents and crimea] estimation of the work.

As a good many of the questions that indispensably require an
answer have already been replied to in that part of the Introduction
that concerns De Ente Praedicamentali, we can here afford to be
brief, merely dealing with such points as must almost exclusively be
considered as peculias to these ‘thirteen logical and philosophical
questions'. The first is the collection of heterogeneous matters under
an argumentative form, to which we cannot find a parallel in any other
of Wyclif’s productionS. As the title indicates the subject of each
question in almost every case, it were needless to repeat them here
in order. Only 11, concerning the forms of hypothetical propositions,
IX which discusses the different theories of ideation by means os
intellect, and XIII upon the sources of cognition can properly be
called problems of logie, dealing with the formal laws of right
reasoning. ln the choice ,os the other debatable matters, Wyclif seems
above all to have consulted variety. I and VIII discuss the creation
of the world and the time and conditions of its existence; III, IV
and VII have to do with free-will, the happiness of man, and the
possession of siches, V and X go into the nature of the First Cause
and the Prima Substantia; Vl enquire whether and how the heavens
are composed of matter and form3 XI deals with the indivisibility of
forms in animated beings; and lastly XII is an exceedingly curious
investigation into the nature of cometsl

But each of these questions is solved according to the same
fixed and invariable plan. First, arguments in favour of one opinion,
and then reasons proving the opposite⁷ are adduced: certain general
principles are then laid down, from which conclusions and corollaries
are drawn, until at length the truth or falsehood of the first proposition
appears. lt would however be a great mistake to infer from the
shortness of each question, taken separately, and this mechanical way
of solving them all, that the results of the disquisitions are themselves
of but small value. Two or three remarks will suffice to make this
clear. As for the question os free-will, v. g. there is no doubt (and
this we can most decidedly affirm), that Wyclif follows Anselrn very
closely (p. 247 and seq.) Rarely has it been stated in so terse and
