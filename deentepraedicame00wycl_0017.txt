INTRODUCTION. XIII

3. Anthenticity and date.

We have already pointed out that the whole of De Ente Predz'-
camentali, as also the various treatises of De Ente sive summa in-
tellectialium, are but parts of the same whole, and belong to each
other as such. We have noted the quotations which prove it to
belong to that whole, and we have alluded to the position of De
Ente Predicamentalz· in the MS. 4307. It is therefore quite unnecessary
to bring forwards any further proofs concerning the authenticity of
this work, or to attempt to demonstrate that both method and style
have the true Wycliffian ring throughout, that the circle of writers
whose ideas he brings to his aid are exactly adapted to the world
of ideas in which he habitually moves; and that the Doctor Evangelicus
never swerves from the sense of Scripture in the theories which he
propounds. Yet we cannot help observing certain important, though
less apparent, idiosyncrasies: for instance, a marked liking for examples
taken from optics and physiCS, as on p. 97,1 and the repetition of
certain favourite examples taken from other authors, are to be found
here as in the other works of Wyclif (p. 82, 10).

If, however, nothing prevents‘ a satisfactory solution of this
problem‚ we cannot say the same of the other, relative to the date
of the work. The question has already been debated by a known
authority. Buddensieg2 speaking of Wyclif’s doctrine on annihilation,
assigns the year 1362 to its appearance3 but he adds a note of inter-
rogation that leaves us in doubt3 and the Editor, not hoping for
greater certitude, does not venture to fix a lirnit. There is only one
positive and undoubted fact to start frorn: viz., that in 1360, Wyclif
had already prepared most of his logical and philosophical treatises.
If therefore we assign a date a few years later to his most voluminous
and ripest work in this field of inquiry, we shall probably not be
far-wrong. There is no trace whatever of political or theological
debate33 we may therefore infer that when Wyclif wrote De Ente,
he had not yet entered the are'na that was to bring him such great
renown.
