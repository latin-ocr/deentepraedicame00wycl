INTRODUCTION. IX

indeed incomplete3 but not so truncated as to leave no indication
that the original plan of the copyist was to introduce in that place
the present treatise.

Several pages are left blank at the very spot where De Ente
Praedicamentalz· should have been, the scribe obviously intending to
insert this treatise at some more convenient time. This also accounts
for the want of a prologue to the sixth treatise.

Besides this important fact, many intrinsic proofs confirm the
truth of our hypothesis. We hardly find in any of Wyclif’s hitherto
published works so many quotations from himself as in De Ente
Praedicamentali: they have all been collected in the “Index of
quotations'⁷.¹ But what gives them so much importance in the present
question is the form in which they are put. Wyclif, at the very outset
(p. 1, 14), says: ut probatum est secundo libro, tractatu de ydeis.
Α little further (p. 2, 24): Secunda pars declarabitur z'n materia de
ydez‘S. Afterwards (p. 12, 13 and 32): oportet notare dicta tractatu
primo, capitulo 4⁰ . . . . Ideo, sicut dictum est tractatu primo, capitulo
primo, And lastly (p. 118): sicut est dare primum intellectum et
volitum extra deum . . . ut patebit secundo libro. All these references
to a liber secundus in which the subject is dealt with more fully,
or to a tractatus primus in which the point in question has already
been discussed‚ can have no meaning unless we admit that De Ente
Praedicamentalz‘ is part of a whole to which both tractatus primus·
and liber secundus belong, This great work is no other than the two
voluminous books De Ente. Wyclif’s multitudinous quotations all agree
perfectly well with the divisions of the work as given in the MS. of
Trinity Coll. Cambr„ Β. 16, 12; and we may for brevity⁷s sake, refer
the reader to the different places where they occur in the text.

2. Contents of the work.

’ After the foregoing explanations, we may study the work from
the stand-point of its philosophical contents and value. As has been
seen, the author considers it as a part of a whole3 but the place he

¹ We of course except tvvo sentences· from the Trialogus and the De Com—
positione Hominis, which are placed in the Index merely for the sake of completeness
as they are accompained by no signs of quotation.
