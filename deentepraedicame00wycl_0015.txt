INTRODUCTION. XI

Chapter 10 is a very singular one. While continuing the foregoing
discussion about the identity or difference of action and passion, he
enters upon a quite different subject, which it was at first very difficult
for the editor to understand. At the beginning of the chapter
(pp. 102——105)‚ Wyclif lays down six points, which the reader will
find in the side-notes. But the difficulty of discovering what those
six points in debate signify, proceeds from the fact that instead of
laying down the arguments pro and contra, as usual with him, and thus
ending the discussion at once, he prolongs it through a considerable
part of the work (about thirty pages). Thus we find that he mentions
the first point on p. 102 and discusses it on p. 108; the second, on
p. 103 and p. 1123 the third on p. 104 and p. 1183 the fourth on
p. ¹2¹3 the fifth on p. 1253 and the sixth, stated on p. 105, appears
only at p. 131: so that the questions concerning action and passion
are dealt with in the most comprehensive way throughout chapters XI,
XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI. This is all the more remarkable, as showing
that Wyclif was extremely methodical in his treatment of every part
of this work, and that he strictly adheres throughout to the plan laid
down: and it is clear that the treatise before us is a mature and
deeply meditated productiori of the illustrious writer.

The discussion of the idea of Action in its highest form, the
action of God‚ particularly in the concursus Dei ad actum is also
continued in Chapter XV113 and as the Divine concursus to every event
is an indispensable requisite, it is asked whether bad actions are
included in this assertion3 for, according to Wyclif, God is the Supreme
Genus of all praedicabilia, so that everything predicable appears as
a creature of God. Here the author answers with much truth that
the per se malum does not exist any more than the inseparabiliter
malum, because their non-existence is caused by God; and that for
the same reason there is nothing evil volitum et inseparabiliter. The
will and action of Lucifer are here adduced as an instance. His
determination to be “like unto God'', was good: the fault lay only
in the manner of carrying it out (p. 161). This section of the work
(which is continued into Chapter XVIII) is one of the most perfect of
the whole treatise, and may be called the culmination of the development
of Wyclif’s doctrines. We may perhaps look upon this as a strange
culmination, that sets up God as the First Cause of all Predicaments,
