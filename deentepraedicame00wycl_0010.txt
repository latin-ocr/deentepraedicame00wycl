VI INTRODUCTION.

quod ens commzmissimzmz etc. The same title is repeated, nearly in
the same words, not only by Shirley (Catalogue, p. 2) but also in
the Tabulae Codicum, vol. 2, s, n. 4307. In Denis' notice, it may
seem strange that absque titulo is immediately followed by so precise
a description of the heading: De Ente Particulari. Yet it does not
follow that the heading is of Denis' invention. lt is true that we
find no title upon fol. 190‘, where the work begins3 but at the top
ff. 193 and 194 we read an abbreviated title as follows: d' ente p‘rztff

which is the first part of the first book De Ente (Shirley, p. 2, No 8,

Book I). The same heading is also on the following pages but divided,
so that half is on each page. The following diagram will explain these

details yet more clearly:

and so on until f. 167¹, where Tractatus Primus comes to an end,
and a note in red i1.k, evidently by the same hand, says: Explicit
