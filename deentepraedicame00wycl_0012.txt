VIII INTRODUCTION.

(p. 2, NO 8, Book I, 4), although he has read circa for contra. This
treatise ends at f. 1903 it is perhaps incomplete, as the desinit of
the Vienna MS. (saltem si deus vellet, non superflueret) is not in
agreement with that of Shirley.

Here we come to the critical point of the whole question. De
Ente Praedicamentali begins on f. 190¹, and on 193‘ and ¹94 we read:

F. 193¹ F. 194

This heading, taken together with the former ones, completely
decides the following points:

1. That this treatise is the fifth by order of the different works
of which the series begins on f. 158 of Shirley's Cod. 4307.

2. That they are all parts of one great whole: De Ente in
Communi; i. e. of the first book of the Summa.

3. That the treatise on f. 185, though not provided with a
separate heading, is obviously the fourth by order.

4. And that the treatise De Ente Praedicamentali is not, as has
been hitherto believed, a distinct work, but an integral part of the
book De Ente,· that is, the fifth division of the first book; and there-

versalibus and De Tempore, are really the sixth and seventh parts
of the work.

The question follows, how far this view is borne out by the MS.
of Trinity ColI. Cambridge, B. 16, 2 which Shirley calls the “MS. of
the whole work except the prologue of I. Tract. 6’'; whether it merely
bears testimony to the text of De Ente Praedicamentali, or has more
lacunes than those mentioned by Shirley; in a word, whether the
fifth treatise is or is not completely wanting.

By the friendly services of Mr. MattheW, my fellow-worker of
the Wyclif Society‚ I have been enabled to ascertain that the MS. is
