INTRODUCTION. XV

our edition of De Compositione Hominis, and therefore requiring no
further detailed description.1

This circumstance renders it necessary to make all the more of
the text, as it stands in the only existing source, and examine it
more thoroughly: but here there is no sufficient foundation for a
critical review of the text. As the many corrections (partly copied in
the Adnotatio critica) obviously show, it was not transcribed as
carefully as might have been desired. Mistakes of quite an elementary
order are to be met with, which certainly have their source in igno-
rance alone. The manus altera of the corrector was indispensable in
many and many a passage. Sometimes whole words are left out, and
others are inadvertently repeated. ln this edition we have kept to
the plan of supplying the omitted words in italics‚ and of enclosing
within brackets those that have been superfluously repeated.

These unintentional omissions lead us to a subject closely allied
with them: the more considerable gaps with which the text abounds.
We do not allude even to the omission of individual sentences (see
pp. 69, 118, 199, &c.) but to the more regrettable fact that we do
not edit Wyclif’s De Ente predicamenta& in the form given to it by
the author: it is shortened and mutilated. This occurs not only
towards the end of the book (we have already mentioned the circum-
stance that, of the tres modi dicendi, p. 213, only one has been
transmitted to us) but throughout the treatise3 it is many
important places, disfigured by considerable gaps. Thus neither the
fourth chapter nor its epilogue winds up in the way we are led to
expect3 and the same observation applies to the appendices of Ch. V,

1 I cannot here pass over the fact that Prof. Loserth‚ noticing my edition of
De Compositione Hominis in Sybel's Historische Zeitschrz'ft‚ has pointed out
several mistakes -—- for the most part clerical errors -- in the description of the
MS..1f the reader takes into consideration that my Introduction was written in
Madrid, and not at all subsequently corrected by me, he will surely view those
oversights with indulgence. But if Prof. Loserth thinks that his duty as the reviewer
of so arduous a work goes no farther than to note these unimportant corrigenda,
and to ascribe it only philosophical interest, I must raise a protest against
such a proceeding: all the more earnesssy, because a man who knows by his own
personal experience all the difficulties of an edition of Wyclif, might be expected
to review rather less cursorily a work that is the fruit of many years of laborious

rese-arches.
