XII INTRODUCTION.

and absolutely denies the genus of malum per se. But it bears witness
to most profound philosophical and theological thought, valuable
chiefly on account of the pleasing light it throws on the humble and
pious character of the writer.

We are quite justified in calling this section a culminating point
or finishing touch. The next paragraph discusses an altogether different
subject-matter3 so much so, indeed, that we may reasonably believe
that so brusque a transition is the result rather of the very corrupt
state in which the MS. has corne down to us, than of the author's
original plan. It is hardly possible to conceive Wyclif writing: Con-
sequens est videre quam extense sit loquendum de tempore, directly
after his disquisitions concerning Lucifer and sin. And our suspicions
are still further strengthened by the fact that at the end of Ch. XVIII
a considerable part of f. 2321 is left blank.

The details concerning time-sequences again follow Aristotle's
Categories step by step. But here also Wyclif sets out with the
aeternitas dei, who waS‚ xiS‚ and will be per onznia saecula saeculorum
(p. 180). From this truth our author works out several conclusions
intended to give us a right index of Time, of the Successive, and of
the InstantaneouS. Unfortunately we are not able to go very deep
into these details, as the proof that a Before and an Afterusards exist
requires an enormous scaffolding of assumptions (p. 187, 188). Of
course we have the evolution of the verb de praesenti as thus restricted
in its meaning (Ch. XX). At a given instant of time, the successivum
is absolutely inconceivable, for it is made up omnibus suis partibus
per ordinem sibi succedentibus. This conception is linked, in a manner
that reminds us of Aristode, with the solution of the question
whether condensation (densari) or rarefaction (rarefieri) of time is
possible (Ch. XXI); after which the author again takes up the question
of ampliatio verbi de praesenti, and settles it with a considerable
number of quotations from various authors. This chapter is the end
of the present, but perhaps not of the original text. It is certain that
the treatise, as it stands, is unfinished; of the tres modi dicendi which
relate to the meaning of the verbum de praesenti, only one is dealt
with, the first. But we have certainly no reason to ascribe this to
the author rather than to the copyist.
