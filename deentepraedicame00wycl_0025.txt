INTRODUCTION. XXI

what an important part this question plays in the gradual development
of Wyclif's theological ideas. In his great work De Ente, he has given
the doctrine of annihilation a different turn.1 But in this place there
is not to be seen the slightest trace of an opinion which he afterwards
expressed with so much conviction. On the contrary, speaking of the
priest‚ Wyclif uses the following unmistakable expressions: “Pane
totaliter et plene cessante existere facit ibi sub specie visibili esse
corpus Cristi &c'’ (p. 232). We must therefore place the date of
the Quaestiones XIII rather earlier, between De Composicione Hominis
and De Ente; and to fix the date yet more accurately, between 1360
ancl 1362, though nearer the former than the latter.

3. State of the Manuscript.

The XIII quaestiones are unfortunately to be found only in a single
MS. It is the Codex of the Universityf Library at Prague, V, E. 14.
a paper Manuscript of 220 numbered leaves, and several others not
numbered 15 >< 21²5 centim. Upon the wooclen binding outside is the
following inscription on two bits of parchment:

which we may read thus: Questiones — Wiltleph de probandis propo-
sicionibus et de yppoteticis et questionibus (P) proposicionum. The
srnaller piece of parchment is evidently an old library number. The
MS. belongs to the XVth century.

With regard to the contents, we have only to notice that the
Quaestiones extend from f. 177 to 202, and may refer the reader for
the rest of the MS. to a very interesting publication of Mr. Dziewicki,
which is shortly to appear. He is at present making the MS. the object
of his most serious study.

The circumstance that caused the‘greatest difficulty in forming
a text, in the case of De Ente Praedicamentali, was that we could
recur to but one source; but the difficulty is greatly enhanced in
