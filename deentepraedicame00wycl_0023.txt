INTRODUCTION. XIX

pregnant a form that the loss of the will is a much greater injury
than any temporal loss, that the voluntary abandonment of that will
is a far more criminal act than suicide, and that the restitution of
free—will to the sinner by the grace of God is a miracle far more
stupendous than the raising of the dead. No less important is the
discussion on happiness, how far and by what means this desire of
man can be appeased and satiated3 it is dwelt upon at considerable
length (p. 251 and seq.) Wyclif grants that earthly concupiscence may
in some cases be satisfied by that which is temporally desirable: but,
says he very pointedly, that cannot be “racione et racionabiliter’',
nor “plene et totaliter sine errore'’. Only the “ultimus finis simpliciter''
is able to give true and complete satisfaction to the yearning heart
of man: which no temporal good can do. It is extremely remarkable
that Wyclif is here thinking, not of the contemplatio Dei of Christian
saith, but of Aristotle's Metaphysics and of his conception of the
summum bonum infinitum, to which our author seems to revert.
We cannot but notice a very interesting development that occurs
in Wyclif's handling of the seventh question: Of riches. Riches, he
concludes (p. 267) are useful even for a virtuous man. The possession
of riches is allowed, because indigentia temporalis exists. But, he
continues, what would happen if this indigentia no longer obtained?
All things would then be possessed in common, “quia in extrema
necessitate status miserie omnia debent esse communia, sicut aer
necessarius omnibus debet esse conznzunis''. It is clear that Wyclif falls
by only one step to reach the doctrine of Communism, now so much
in vogue, which considers this extremus status as already existing in
reality. We will not try to find in these words more than they
contain: but they unmistakeably bridge over the gap between our
author's earlier opinions and those social and political theories which
inspired him and were translated into actions at a later period.

’ Power and energy of language‚ a keen logical acumen and
plenitude of learning give value to this remarkable collection of
questions, and make them to rank equally with the other works of
the same writer in the same field. If the latter contain profounder
doctrine, the XIII Quaestiones are excellent contributions to dialectical
discussion: the opposition of affirmative and negative theses, the pro

and contra os contradictory arguments, are all made to serve his
Β.
