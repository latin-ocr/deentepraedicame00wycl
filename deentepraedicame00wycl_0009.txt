INTRODUCTION.

The publication of the two philosophical works, De Enle Praedi-
camentali and Quaestiones XIII, is the fulfilment of a promise made
five years ago by the writer, in his edition of De Composicione hominis,
to edit some more of Wyclif's philosophical works, and thus to make
this great master⁷s system of thought better known. I began these
ulterior labours in 1886, by copying the Quaestiones for the Wyclif
Society3 but they were interrupted and unavoidably postponed for
some time on account of travels and various other engagements.1At
length Dr. Furnivall‚ whose untiring activity in all matters concerning
Wyclifis so well known, prevailed upon me to edit the Questiones XIII;
and as this treatise was not sufficient to make up a volume, another
was to be adjoined to it, Ι chose De Ente Praedicamentali, copied the
MS. in 1888—1889, and continued preparing the volume for press up
to the present time.

I must add a few remarks, necessary for a just appreciation both
of the treatises themselves and of the present edition as it stands.

Ι. De Ente praedicamentali.

1. 'risse and place of the work in Wyclif's philosophica] writings.

The first question regards the title. The earliest writer, so far
as Ι know, who mentions this work is Michael Denis, in bis Codices
Manuscripti theologici Bibliothecae Palatinae Vindobonensis. Vindo-
bonae 1794, Vol. I, part. II, page 1511. His mention runs thus:
Cod. CCCVI‚fol. 190, p, 2. Absque titul0; tractatus De Ente Particulari
qui incipit: Suppositis exsuperius declaratis et declarandis¹ in posterum

¹ Our edition has dicendis, the only right reading of ddis.
