INTRODUCTION. XVII

difficulties that were primarily the cause of the delay in the publishing
and printing of the present treatise.

A conscientious verification of the sources fron] which Wyclif
drew, is, it is quite true, not without interest. We at once see that
the author prepared himself for none of his yet published works —
not even for the Trialogus —- with such care and study of other
writers as for De Ente Predicamentali. Wyclif does not indeed
always quote Aristotle or other philosophers immediately3 he often
does so indirectly through the writings of other celebrated men (se'e
p. 102 note3 p. 167 and particularly, p. 135), especially Bradwardine
(from whom he often quotes the ‘philosopher')‚ Anselm and others.
But is would not be by any means allowable to conclude that he
was not perfectly acquainted with the great masters of thought whose
works he thus quotes at second hand. Not only in Scripture and
in the Fathers‚ but also in Scholastic lore, Wyclif is quite at home3
he knows all about the old grammarians and mathematicians as well
as about the Stagyrite and his Arabian commentators. It is curious
to attempt to buckle on the armour of learning which the students and
masters of an English University in the second half of the XIVth
century had to wear. Writings of which the titles are now scarcely
known (much less read), were then in general use as a sort of
intellectual panacea,· other logical and philosophical books, then
supremely important, have now fallen into complete oblivion. Plato
is known to Wyclif only by Aristotle and Augustine3 but he is quite
master of all his sources of knowledge, and deals with them as he
choosesstvssut it is not our task to go into these phases of Wyclif’s
mental activity and thought: it belongs much rather to such as use
and study his works. And if we have been able to put into their
hands for this purpose an edition which, though not without many
imperfections‚ is yet of real use to them, all the trouble that we have
taken will have been amply rewarded.

1 This may be seen in his original manner of expounding the Bible, his
controversy against Aristode, and in general with all the authors that he quotes⁷
whether patristic or profane. Note especially his treatment of a certain letter of

Grosseteste, p. 148, l. 13—-15.
