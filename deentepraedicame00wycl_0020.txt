XVI INTRODUCTIO N.

which have certainly not corne down to us in their first form. It is
much more probable to assert, that on the contrary, each of these
paragraphs was originally a complete and separate section. On pp. 202
and 203 we meet with wide gaps, of which the series might perhaps
be much more numerous, had we any sure test at hand by which to
discover them. ssut our unique MS. is the only witness to the text, and
we have to deal with it alone. It will be seen hy whoever takes the
trouble to study our method of arranging the text, that it is strictly
conservative in this sense, that we have carefully avoided tampering
with it unless in cases of absolute necessity. In all that concerns the
desideratum of legibility, we have kept as close as possible to the
excellent model given by Dr. Buddensieg3 closer indeed than in our
first edited work. This may be especially noted in the punctuation
(which cannot be too frequent with the rambling construction of
Wyclif's sentences) and certain peculiarities of spelling, of which Ι now
recognize the importance. Notwithstanding all this, a certain amount
of asperity and want of polish, which 1 trust will be excused, was
unavoidable.

A few words more must be said about the explanatory notes
and references, and an observation or two made on a field of work
which gives unspeakable trouble to the Editor. To look at the number
of quotations verified in the author's writings, which, together with
their place, are to be found at the end of the published edition, is
to have but the saintest idea of the trial of patience involved in such
work. Wyclif, as we have seen, often quotes titles of books without
the name of the author, authors without naming their works3 the
quotations are often wrong or not in agreement with the titles and
divisions now given to the works. Of the treatises quoted, many are
to be found only in first editions, or in MS. Only the man who has
gone through the test can properly understand what it is to read a
whole MS. or printed book for the sake of a quotation, in some
cases only to say that the work was all in vain and must be gone
through once more. Now if we consider that Wyclif, in the De Ente
Praedicamentalz· and the XIII Questiones makes almost five hundred
such quotations, we may perhaps see that the editor's patience must
have undergone a hard trial, with such endless work and such enormous
waste of time -— often with so little to show for it. These were the
