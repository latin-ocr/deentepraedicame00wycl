INTRODUCTION. XXIII

well aware that Wyclif understood and studied Aristotle7 Euclid and
Theodosius only in their Latin translations.

If we consider the wealth of quotations in these Quaestiones,
we at once perceive the enormous preparation and study requisite
for each thesis (cf. the question on Comets), and the extent to which
the writer *vas master of his work: in this point of view, the second
treatise is by* no means inferior to the first.

‘'s. the conclusion of our Introduction a very pleasant duty
remams ‘to be fulfilled: Ι beg to thank all those whose kind aid
'nas forwarded the completion of this work. It is already well known
how much the Managers of the Wyclif Society have deserved of
learning for their publication of these works. Most especially would
I thank Mr. F. D. Matthew, who not only took the trouble to translate
my side-notes⁷ but very carefully and at a great sacrifice of leisure
and repose several times looked through every one of the proof sheets.
The result of this aid rendered valuable by Mr. Matthew's ripe
experience and erudition, has been a great many corrections, excellent
hints and useful explanations, that I have inserted in almost every
page of the book. I here beg to offer Mr. Matthew the thanks which
are due to him sor his labour and sels-denial.

The Editor wishes at the same time to name the man to whom
this edition is inscribed. The active good will and ever-ready help
of Herr Hofratlz Ritter von 132·ch have never once failed me in all
rny studies and labours. For this assistence, both in counsel and by
acts, my dedication of this work to him is but a very small token
of gratitude; appropriate, however, in so far as I have chosen the
occasion when the veteran amongst the librarians of Austria now closes
his sixtieth year of administrative service.

In the very numerous problems that have arisen as to the
authorities cited by Wyclif and the difficulties in deciphering the
MS;I have received much assistance from Herr Custos Dr. Goeldlin
von Tiefenau, whose experience and knowledge was of great service
to me3 1 may also thank Mr. Dziewicki‚ who unfortunately joined the
band of Wyclif workers only quite lately. And lastly I Wish to
acknowledge the kindness of the Directors of Prague University for
twice sending me the codex V. E. 14.

Vienna, September 1890.
