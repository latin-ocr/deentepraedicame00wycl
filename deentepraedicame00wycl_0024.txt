XX INTRODUCTION.

purpose, and to draw the desired conclusion together with its con—
sequences. And it is quite in agreement with this point of view that
the questions chosen belong to such evidely different subjects of in-
vestigation. The author wished to show how useful the dialectical
method is in such various matterS, and what advantages may be
gained by following that plan.

2. Anthentieity and Date of the work.

We have but very few external proofs that the Quaestiones XIII
are a genuine work of Wyclif. There is neither inscriptio nor sub-
scriptio naming or even indicating Wyclif as the author. Yet we find it
along with other works of Wyclif (see below>3 and some writing on
the cover of the MS. which we shall have occasion to mention
more at length, and which was certainly of the sarne date as the
volume itself, seems to refer to the treatise in the words questiones
proposicionum. ssut here intrinsic evidence abundantly makes up for
the want of extrinsic proof. As already remarked, not only a series
of ideas peculiar to Wyclif, but the form, the diction, the dialectical
acuteness, make it an easy task to recognize the author of works
already known to US. The sources quoted in the work belong to the
same general circle of writers, save that they are here slightly
enlarged by a few new quotationS. And our demonstration may be
considered as complete, if we add some details that are seemingly
without importance. Take, v. g. the example on p. 2953 “manente
eodem serpente, abscisa aliqua parte eius, manet eadem forma sub-
stanciali, que prius fuit'’ (from Augustine, De Quantitate Animae,
XXXI, 62, on p. 295); it is repeated, and repeated in the same
manner in Wyclif’s book De Compositione Hominis. We may say
the same of his interesting treatment of the theory of ideas, a com-
parison of the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle which co·1·ncides with
a similar passage in the Trialogus. Thus each of these treatises are
links in a chain, and connected one with another.

There is one passage which is of very great importance in fixing
the date of the work. Towards the end of Qu. I, Wyclif examines
the signification of the verb creare, and gives as an example the
transsubstantiation that takes place in the Mass. Now it is well known
