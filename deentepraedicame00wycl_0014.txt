X INTRODUCTION.

assigns it is not accidenta13 it is the result of a plan well thought out,
and in strict harmony with an inflexible arrangement of each separate
part. When Wyclif quoted preceding and subsequent developments
of his doctrine, he had probably already completed the whole of
De Eme in his mind. The basis of his system was so firm, so
unshakable‚ that such references as these: “We have discussed the
question at length in the first treatise: . . . this will be dealt with in
the second book;'' far from doing any injury to the work, are of
real use, as aiding towards a comprehensive view, of the whole. But
the consequence is a difficulty that critics ought not to underrate:
how can we properly appreciate a work that is not indepedent,
and has no value except as connected with what precedes and follows
it? And such an appreciation will be possible only when all the
contents of the Trinity MS. are published.

As concerns the work in itself‚ especially the first part, the title
De Ente Praedicamentali is well chosen. In the first eleven chapters‚
Wyclif follows pretty closely the plan of the celebrated Organon,
then a classical work.1 After having dealt in general with predicamental
being in the first chapter, which concludes thus (p. 14) omnia novem
predicamenta accidencium reducuntur ad cathegoriam substanciae ut
suum principium, he imitates Aristotle and gives us a preliminary
discussion of the known subjects — the Aequivoca and the Univoca
(cap. Ι, Categ.). Afterwards (ch. IV, V.) he treats of the very foundation
of all the categories‚ coinciding with the ideas ens or genus: these
Chapters correspond more or less closely to cap. 2, 3, Categ. The
sixth chapter deals with quantity (cap. 4, Categ.). Chapters 7 and 8
have to do with Relation (cap. 5, Categ.), which is stated to be
naturaliter consequens ad quantitatem et qualitatem. Quality is not
admitted to be a category‚ as Aristotle affirms (cap. 6, Categ.). Wyclif
derives the genus Action immediately from that. of Relation and deals
with the idea of movement‚ which he includes in the former. The last
chapter is but the prelude of a question which will be debated throughout
several other sections; viz: whether Action and passion are identical.

¹ lt is obvious that we cannot here discuss the controversial question as to
whether the Categories7 as they now stand, are really the work of Aristotle (see
Prema, Geschichte der Logik im Abendlamte, l, p. 90).
